# [Project 1: Data Science Housing Prices: Project Overview](https://github.com/ArvidLev/Housing_SalePrice_Kaggle)
For this project I estimated SalePrice of houses using methods from tidymodels such as rsampel, recipe, workflow, parsnip, tune and yardstick.
* Cleaned and preproccesed data by imputing, dummy variables, remove near zero variance columns.
* Used ElasticNet, MARS and RandomForest which I tuned using 5-fold crossvalidation
* Selected the best model using RMSE

# [Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis League Of Legends: Project Overview](https://github.com/ArvidLev/LeagueOfLegends.git)
For this project I worked on data from esport games, more specifically League Of Legends esport.
Using data exploration I found variabels that I thought would be good predictors for the outcome of a game.
I used a logistic regression model and evaluated its performance and its coefficients in order to get an idea of how well the predictors were at predicting the outcome of the game.
To do this I used,
* Tidyverse to manipulate, clean and visualize the data.
* Tidymodels to analyze and train the data.
