# [Project 1: Data Analysis with R: Housing Prices Kaggle](https://github.com/ArvidLev/Housing_SalePrice_Kaggle)
For this project I estimated SalePrice of houses using methods from tidymodels such as rsampel, recipe, workflow, parsnip, tune and yardstick.
* Cleaned and preproccesed data by imputing, dummy variables, remove near zero variance columns.
* Used ElasticNet, MARS and RandomForest which I tuned using 5-fold crossvalidation
* Selected the best model using RMSE

# [Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis with R: Esport](https://github.com/ArvidLev/LeagueOfLegends.git)
For this project I worked on data from esport games, more specifically League Of Legends esport.
Using data exploration I found variabels that I thought would be good predictors for the outcome of a game.
I used a logistic regression model and evaluated its performance and its coefficients in order to get an idea of how well the predictors were at predicting the outcome of the game.
To do this I used,
* Tidyverse to manipulate, clean and visualize the data.
* Tidymodels to analyze and train the data.

# [Project 3: Data Visualization with Tableau: Esport](https://public.tableau.com/views/Book1_16332383257090/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
This project I used Tableau to create dashboards for the Esports data created in project 2. I made a dashboard where you can select a team from any of the 4 big regions and then you select a specfic game of theirs and get more game specific data visualized.
# [Project 4: Data Analysis with Python: Wine Quality](https://github.com/ArvidLev/WineQuality)
For this data analysis project I explored a wine quality dataset.
  - Used matplotlib, seaborn to perform data exploration and data visalization.
  - Binned target variable to create a classification problem instead of a regression problem
  - Used RandomForest, XGBoost and cross-validation to create a model.
  - Explored the feature importance of the models using their GINI scores
